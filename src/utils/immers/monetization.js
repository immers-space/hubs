/* Handles monetization feature-checking, api, and initialization race.
 * Immers creators can listen for events on the scene that are guaranteed to
 * occur after initial scene and entity load. Monetization status is synced to
 * the room currently via player-info. This has two limitations, 1) easy to spoof
 * and 2) doesn't sync while players are still in lobby. A better implemenation 
 * would be to extend the reticulum server to support this over hubChannel.
 * 
 * Events (emitted from scene element):
 *  immers-monetization-started - local user monetization began/resumed
 *  immers-monetization-stopped - local user monetization ceased
 *  immers-monetization-progress - local user micropayment received.
 *    detail:
 *      amount: Number, amount received on this transation
 *      totalAmoint: Number, amount received so far during this session
 *      currency: String, currency of the transation
